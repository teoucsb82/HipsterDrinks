## by Teo Dell'Amico

Hipster Drinks is a social rating/sharing site for classy cocktails. 

Users can search the drinks database by name or ingredient and have the ability to rate, comment, favorite, [pin](www.pinterest.com), [tweet](www.twitter.com) or [like](www.facebook.com) the drink. Users are also encouraged to submit their own drinks through the link at the top of the page. 

Each user has a profile page where they can view their favorite/submitted drinks and any other users they have following/follower relationships with.

Built on Rails and reinforced with jQuery, [HipsterDrinks](www.hipsterdrinks.com) is my final project for the January 2014 App Academy cohort.
