Hipster Drinks is a social rating/sharing site for classy cocktails. Users can search the drinks database by name or ingredient and have the ability to rate, comment, favorite, [pin](www.pinterest.com), [tweet](www.twitter.com) or [like](www.facebook.com) the drink. Each user has a profile page where they can view their favorite/submitted drinks and any other users they have following/follower relationships with.
