Add a "drinks you might like" section -- based off people you follow, do 
*** Add "build a bar" section to USERS. 


# Wed Goals

* Drink show page
- Comments layout/rendering/interface. Maybe lose the tabbed interface, overkill (1hr - 11am)
- "Related drinks" section w/ pictures links (similar to main page) (1hr - 12p)
- On related drinks and front page, change the way picture works. Should have image w/ name + stars displayed below it. On mouseover, give the logline
- Add edit button if you own the drink, make it prominent

* Drinks index page
- Clean up page. Add images sorted by rating (think nv.com). 30 min
-Have tabbed display here to show "ALL DRINKS" (default), "FRESH DRINKS" (new stuff), and "The Essentials" (top 10-20 drinks... think seed drinks). 1 hr
- Add "sort by" links at the top. either do a dropdown, or list of options to click (prefer latter) (10 min)
- Add endless scrolling (1hr)
~4pmish

* Users Profile
- comment out following stuff...not really necessary
- focus on: tabbed display for "favorite drinks", "submitted drinks". for submitted drinks, give edit link options
- show "recently viewed drinks"

normalize drink ingredients. vodka should == VODKA == Vodka
