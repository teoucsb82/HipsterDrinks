--ASK A TA HOW TO FIX THIS
[] Drinks CRUD allows non-logged in users to create drinks. Need to prevent them from having access.
[] Similar issues for users being able to delete/edit non-posts
-- Sort of working, but would like to not display the button / throw an error before acting like it worked

[] Also have questions on filepicker / paperclip w/ Backbone CRUD
